              <!-- Question 1 -->
              <h2>What is a typical lesson like with you?</h2>
              <p>
                Prior to the lesson, students will complete a 5 minute pre-recorded warm-up that will be sent via email after you decide to book with me. Upon arrival, I like to have a warm cup of tea—or apple cider—prepared for my students to sip on throughout their lesson. The vocal coach I worked with in high school did this for me and it was the best. Then, we will discuss goals and songs that we will work on. I do not play piano, so the instrumental track will be played through a speaker. If I hear something vocally that needs to be adjusted, I may stop the music midway through so we can work on it. After the lesson ends, I let my students pick a candy or a prize.
              </p>

              <!-- Question 2 -->
              <h2>What styles of music do you specialize in?</h2>
              <p>
                I specialize in pop, electronic, and the Great American Songbook. However, I can work with most styles.
              </p>

              <!-- Question 3 -->
              <h2>How long until improvement?</h2>
              <p>
                I give my students the tools to improve during our first lesson. Long term improvement can be expected after a minimum of 6 months.
              </p>

              <!-- Question 4 -->
              <h2>What can a student do to improve their voice outside of lessons?</h2>
              <p>
                Hydrate. Hydrate. Hydrate. Drinking water throughout the day is so important for the health of our vocal cords. Also, students should practice the pre-recorded warm-ups (5 minutes) and songs (15-20 minutes) every other day if possible.
              </p>

              <!-- Question 5 -->
              <h2>What if a student is late to a lesson or forgets?</h2>
              <p>
                Life happens, so I extend a 10-minute grace period. If a student cannot make their lesson, please let me know by 12pm the day of the lesson so we can schedule a make-up lesson. If a student is a no-show and no notice is given, the full lesson amount will be charged and no make-up lesson will be offered.
              </p>

              <!-- Question 6 -->
              <h2>Do you offer any discounts?</h2>
              <p>
                I offer $20 off the monthly lesson fee for healthcare workers, military, and first responders. Thank you for all that you do.
