            <p>Hi, I’m Holly and I’m so glad you are here! I am a professional recording artist and vocal coach located in Northern California who specializes in working with kids and teenagers ages 5-17. At 12 years old I recorded and performed a duet with renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli. I went on to perform at the White House 3 times and was featured on Oprah, The Today Show, CNN Showbiz Tonight, CBS Early Morning Show and Access Hollywood among others. I find so much joy in creating a safe space for my students to discover their unique singing voices and unlock their potential as musicians. Music has a way of expressing what words alone cannot and helps us to come out of our shells and be lights in this world. If you would like to book with me, I can be reached by the info listed in the contact section. I look forward to hearing from you and hope you have a wonderful day or night! </p></p>
